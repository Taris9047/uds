* Wine on Debian
Debian is a rock solid and old-school distro which still supports 32bit libraries unlike Ubuntu. Even, we can install Wine through package manager. This walkthough is based on a guide from [[https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-wine-on-debian/][here]]. Since we are running Debian Buster (10), this guide will not consider other versions.

#+begin_src shell :tangle Wine_on_Debian.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash -e
echo "Adding 32bit repo..."
sudo -H dpkg --add-architecture i386 2&>1 /dev/null

echo "Adding WineHq repository for Debian 10 Buster"
wget -O- -q  https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine:/Debian/Debian_10/Release.key | sudo apt-key add -    2&>1 /dev/null
echo "deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine:/Debian/Debian_10 ./" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wine-obs.list 2&>1 /dev/null
#+end_src

Thus, we have set up the Wine official repository for Debian 10.

Then, let's install stable branch.

#+begin_src shell :tangle Wine_on_Debian.sh
sudo -H apt update 2&>1 /dev/null
sudo -H apt -y install --install-recommends winehq-stable 2&>1 /dev/null
#+end_src

Lastly, checking the wine version.
#+begin_src shell :tangle Wine_on_Debian.sh
wine --version
#+end_src

* Winetricks
Wine itself isn't enough to run various Winndows programs. Good thing is we can use [[https://wiki.winehq.org/Winetricks][Winetricks]] anytime.

#+begin_src shell :tangle Wine_on_Debian.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winetricks/winetricks/master/src/winetricks 2&>1 /dev/null
chmod +x ./winetricks
sudo -H mv ./winetricks /usr/local/bin/winetricks
sudo -H apt -y install cabextract 2&>1 /dev/null
#+end_src
